<h1>A collection of work</h1>
<p>
	This is a collection of the things I've done recently in my quest to become a web developer.
</p>

<h3>justinhiltz.com</h3>
<p>When I redid this site I wanted it to be simple and straightforward to update, use a responsive front-end framework, and, as with anything at this stage of my development career, I wanted to learn something new.</p>

<p>I had heard of <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> and the more I looked into it I found it was the perfect fit for the intentions of the project. I can update the site using a simple <code>$ git push</code>. The site is hosted for free by GitHub and I can use my own domain name. Awesome.</p>

<p>For the content of the site I settled on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> which is a static website generator written in Ruby. It has a little web server in it so I can instantly preview my changes before pushing them.</p> 

<p><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a> is the front-end framework I chose to use and I have been very happy with it. The grid is easy to use and the styling is clean and minimal.</p> 

<p>Over the course of building this site I've learned how to use multiple technologies to work together to make something cool. Jekyll uses layout templates and partials so getting that to work nicely with Foundation took some care to prevent duplicate code.</p>

<h3>Ruby on Rails Sample App</h3>
<p>
	I've been learning how to write Rails apps using the excellent <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/">Rails Tutorial</a> by Michael Hartl. Here is my <a href="https://nameless-basin-3231.herokuapp.com">Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App</a> and here is the code <a href="https://github.com/JustinHiltz/sample_app">on Github</a>
