<h3>About myself</h3>

<p>I am a web developer from Toronto with a focus on Ruby on Rails. I have front-end development experience utilizing JavaScript, AngularJS, HTML5, CSS3/Sass/SCSS, Jekyll, and Foundation. I follow test-driven development (TDD) practices using RSpec and minitest. I have some experience developing with PHP as well.</p>

<p>I am consistently trying to learn and improve my programming skills. I have completed the Ruby, JavaScript, AngularJS, HTML & CSS, and PHP tracks from <a href="https://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>, the excellent <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book">Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl</a>, keep sharp by solving problems on <a href="https://codewars.com">Codewars</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of work you will find me riding my bike all over Toronto. I especially enjoy riding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Goodman_Trail">Martin Goodman Trail</a> along the waterfront and the <a href="http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails/view/don-river-trail">Don River Trail</a> on the east end. There are a lot of great craft breweries in Toronto that I like to visit to pick something up to enjoy when I get home. Every summer I get out to some of my favourite provincial parks for camping and canoe trips.</p>

<h3>I listen to a lot of podcasts.</h3>
<p>Here are some of my favourites:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imore.com/debug">Debug </a>with Guy English and Rene Ritchie is a podcast on development mainly for Mac OS and iOS that features prominent developers in casual conversation.</p>
<p><a href="http://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech Podcast </a>with Marco Arment, John Siracusa, and Casey Liss is a tech podcast that mainly focuses on the Apple world but does a good job of discussing tech as a whole and the controversies of the week.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/">Roderick on the Line </a> with Merlin Mann and John Roderick is podcast that is just a conversation between two friends with great stories.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.causticsodapodcast.com/">Caustic Soda </a>with Toren Atkinson, Kevin Leeson, and Joe Fulgham is a podcast about the science, history, and pop culture of the weird, gross and disturbing.</p>
