<h3>About my work</h3>
<p>
	I'm (Cornelis) Justin Hiltz and this is my lovely portfolio site. Currently I'm a student of my own learning web development. I really want to become good at Rails and an all round good developer.
</p>
<h3>About myself</h3>
<p>
	As long as I can remember I have enjoyed computers and electronics. As a kid what I liked best about them was taking them apart and putting them back together. It was so cool seeing how things work and what I could do to change the way that they worked. As I've grown older I'm happier with my laptop and writing software with the same goals. I used to be a Windows guy (gaming) but now I'm a Mac guy.
</p>
<p>
	Aside from computing I love design, podcasts, good food, good beer, good coffee, and the outdoors. An ideal vacation for me is a trek out into the backcountry of my home province of Ontario. The Massassauga, Killarney, Algonquin are all great parks that have some great canoeing destinations. The peace and quiet experienced on a lake where there is no cell signal, human or highway noise is one of the best feelings I know.
