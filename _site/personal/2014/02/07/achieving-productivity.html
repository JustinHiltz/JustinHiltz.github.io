<div class="post">
<p>I have attempted college three times (I&#39;m in my third program now) and I&#39;m still unsure of what I want to do. I left my job to pursue a career as a developer and while I&#39;m in school for that right now I&#39;m not happy with the progress I&#39;ve made. Before I returned to school I had some ideas in my head that I would learn web development in my free time away from my college courses and I&#39;d make some money on the side doing some freelance work. My focus just wasn&#39;t there. I spent a lot of time studying web development technologies but that&#39;s my problem, spending all this time studying different languages and frameworks and not mastering any of them. </p>

<p>The thing is I really do want to become a developer and the web is a platform I find fascinating. It&#39;s such a rapidly expanding world with exciting new technologies coming out every day. It&#39;s overwhelming because I want to try them all so I never get anything done. Coupled with the fact that I critique my work so harshly that I convince myself that I&#39;m not worth the money for someone to hire me. Something that Ira Glass said in and interview on storytelling popped up in my Internet browsing today that I can relate to. He says that [and I&#39;ll get a direct transcription] for the first couple years that you&#39;re making things they won&#39;t be great, at least to you, and that&#39;s because you have great taste. That great taste is what allows you to not put out work that&#39;s &#39;good enough.&#39; I&#39;m somewhere in between the great taste, not good enough and just been plain scared shitless [Merlin? The Shakes poop pants?] to ask people to pay me to do work for them even though I&#39;m quite capable. </p>

<p>So what I&#39;m trying to solve with this post is how do I get myself into a productive place.  How do I put together a killer portfolio to show off to people? How do I organize my time? What language, framework, etc should I choose to master?</p>

<p>Shit that&#39;s a lot of stuff to write about. Clearly this isn&#39;t just going to be a Friday night write this and be done with it. It&#39;s gonna be big and hopefully great.</p>
