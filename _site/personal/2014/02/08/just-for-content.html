<div class="post">
<p>Hey friends, here&#39;s another blog post just created for the sake of filling space to see how things look. I think I&#39;ll use some Samuel L. Ipsum.</p>

<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that&#39;s what you see at a toy store. And you must think you&#39;re in a toy store, because you&#39;re here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>

<p>Like you, I used to think the world was this great place where everybody lived by the same standards I did, then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where righteousness is not rewarded. That&#39;s Cesar&#39;s world, and if you&#39;re not willing to play by his rules, then you&#39;re gonna have to pay the price.</p>

<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show&#39;s called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they&#39;re going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don&#39;t, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

<p>Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every time you come home, they act like they haven&#39;t seen you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is they got different dogs for different people. Like pit bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man&#39;s best friend... or the wrong man&#39;s worst enemy. You going to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.</p>
