	<p><p>Today I did something and I feel proud of myself for accomplishing that. It&#39;s become harder and harder to actually achieve something productive with my time rather than sitting on the computer and looking at reddit or binge-watching a show on Netflix. There&#39;s also a problem I have with &quot;productive procrastination,&quot; where I&#39;ll read about things that could be vaguely related to the things I want to get done but not actually accomplish anything myself. </p>

<p>I feel terrible and guilty every time I have the free time to make something or learn something and improve myself just to waste it away  doing the same lame things I do every day. I always put it off until the next day I have time thinking &quot;I&#39;ll spend my entire day off writing code.&quot; I have a fantastic imagination when it comes to thinking of all the ways I&#39;ll be productive in the future. All the things I&#39;ll get done and skills I&#39;ll perfect. People will be tripping over each other just for the chance to throw their money at me for a small amount of my time. And in my imagination I&#39;m completely capable of that. </p>

<p>But in reality, as soon as I step out of the front door and into the world I become a nervous and unconfident fool who won&#39;t accomplish anything for himself. I feel as though I&#39;m going to be laughed at and thrown out of the building if I apply for a job that I know I&#39;m qualified for. Could this be a touch of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome/" title="Imposter Syndrome">Imposter Syndrome</a>? It&#39;s that fear of failure and making a fool of myself that gets me down and keeps me put in the rut that I&#39;m in and I couldn&#39;t tell you the first step I need to take to get out.</p>

		<small>July 27, 2014</small>
	</h2>
	<p><p>I&#39;m using Windows as my primary operating system at the moment because my Mac died (after I spilled coffee in it) and I don&#39;t have the funds to replace it quite yet. It&#39;s taking longer than I expected to get into the hang of writing code on this thing which is irritating because I finally have time to get back into programming after the busy period at work.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a couple months since I last wrote any serious code and I&#39;ve missed it. Now I want to get back into it and eventually do it professionally. To do that I need to learn a lot more and build some useful applications.</p>

<h3>The start</h3>

<p>I&#39;m going to do a quick refresh of JavaScript and then jump into it a little more in depth. Since I&#39;m comfortable with HTML and CSS I think that&#39;s a pretty good place to start. </p>

<h3>The blog</h3>

<p>To keep track of my learning progress I&#39;m going to write in this blog and post it online.</p>

	<p><p>Hey friends, here&#39;s another blog post just created for the sake of filling space to see how things look. I think I&#39;ll use some Samuel L. Ipsum.</p>

<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that&#39;s what you see at a toy store. And you must think you&#39;re in a toy store, because you&#39;re here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>

<p>Like you, I used to think the world was this great place where everybody lived by the same standards I did, then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where righteousness is not rewarded. That&#39;s Cesar&#39;s world, and if you&#39;re not willing to play by his rules, then you&#39;re gonna have to pay the price.</p>

<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show&#39;s called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they&#39;re going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don&#39;t, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

<p>Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every time you come home, they act like they haven&#39;t seen you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is they got different dogs for different people. Like pit bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man&#39;s best friend... or the wrong man&#39;s worst enemy. You going to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.</p>

	<p><p>I have attempted college three times (I&#39;m in my third program now) and I&#39;m still unsure of what I want to do. I left my job to pursue a career as a developer and while I&#39;m in school for that right now I&#39;m not happy with the progress I&#39;ve made. Before I returned to school I had some ideas in my head that I would learn web development in my free time away from my college courses and I&#39;d make some money on the side doing some freelance work. My focus just wasn&#39;t there. I spent a lot of time studying web development technologies but that&#39;s my problem, spending all this time studying different languages and frameworks and not mastering any of them. </p>

<p>The thing is I really do want to become a developer and the web is a platform I find fascinating. It&#39;s such a rapidly expanding world with exciting new technologies coming out every day. It&#39;s overwhelming because I want to try them all so I never get anything done. Coupled with the fact that I critique my work so harshly that I convince myself that I&#39;m not worth the money for someone to hire me. Something that Ira Glass said in and interview on storytelling popped up in my Internet browsing today that I can relate to. He says that [and I&#39;ll get a direct transcription] for the first couple years that you&#39;re making things they won&#39;t be great, at least to you, and that&#39;s because you have great taste. That great taste is what allows you to not put out work that&#39;s &#39;good enough.&#39; I&#39;m somewhere in between the great taste, not good enough and just been plain scared shitless [Merlin? The Shakes poop pants?] to ask people to pay me to do work for them even though I&#39;m quite capable. </p>

<p>So what I&#39;m trying to solve with this post is how do I get myself into a productive place.  How do I put together a killer portfolio to show off to people? How do I organize my time? What language, framework, etc should I choose to master?</p>

<p>Shit that&#39;s a lot of stuff to write about. Clearly this isn&#39;t just going to be a Friday night write this and be done with it. It&#39;s gonna be big and hopefully great.</p>

		<small>February 07, 2014</small>
	</h2>
	<p><p>For the sake of adding some more content as filler here is an excerpt from <em>War of the Worlds</em> by H.G. Wells:</p>

<p>The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big crescent of shipping, and the low Essex coast was growing blue and hazy, when a Martian appeared, small and faint in the remote distance, advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness.  At that the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and anger at his own delay, and the paddles seemed infected with his terror.  Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of the steamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than the trees or church towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human stride.</p>

<p>It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more amazed than terrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberately towards the shipping, wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell away.  Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another, striding over some stunted trees, and then yet another, still farther off, wading deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway up between sea and sky.  They were all stalking seaward, as if to intercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between Foulness and the Naze.  In spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of the little paddle-boat, and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind her, she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance.</p>

<p>Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large crescent of shipping already writhing with the approaching terror; one ship passing behind another, another coming round from broadside to end on, steamships whistling and giving off volumes of steam, sails being let out, launches rushing hither and thither.  He was so fascinated by this and by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for anything seaward.  And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she had suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong from the seat upon which he was standing.  There was a shouting all about him, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answered faintly.  The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards from their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of a plough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in huge waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddles helplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck down almost to the waterline.</p>

		<small>February 05, 2014</small>
	</h2>
	<p><p>Before this blog I was attempting to build a Rails blogging engine. I didn&#39;t give up on it so much as it wasn&#39;t the best use of my time. Blogging platforms have to many little detail features that make it time consuming. It&#39;s easy to get the big picture nailed down and forget all the little bits and pieces behind the scenes. So I&#39;ve decided to host a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> blog on <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. It&#39;s free and easy, I can write in Markdown and have it automatically converted to HTML. A simple git push keeps it current.</p>

<p>I&#39;m blogging because I think it&#39;s an excellent way to think about and analyze the content I&#39;m always reading. I read so many headlines and skim so many articles that if a pub held a <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">HN</a> or <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a> themed triva night I&#39;d be the champ. But I don&#39;t develop my own opinions or arguments for what I read and I want to change that. Also, I want to improve my writing skills. Right now I write like a highschool english C student and I want to bring that up to at least a B+.</p>

<p>Hopefully there are a few posts already written after this one and they&#39;ve improved. Maybe later on there will be something you find interesting to keep you coming back. </p>
