	<p><p>I&#39;m using Windows as my primary operating system at the moment because my Mac died (after I spilled coffee in it) and I don&#39;t have the funds to replace it quite yet. It&#39;s taking longer than I expected to get into the hang of writing code on this thing which is irritating because I finally have time to get back into programming after the busy period at work.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a couple months since I last wrote any serious code and I&#39;ve missed it. Now I want to get back into it and eventually do it professionally. To do that I need to learn a lot more and build some useful applications.</p>

<h3>The start</h3>

<p>I&#39;m going to do a quick refresh of JavaScript and then jump into it a little more in depth. Since I&#39;m comfortable with HTML and CSS I think that&#39;s a pretty good place to start. </p>

<h3>The blog</h3>

<p>To keep track of my learning progress I&#39;m going to write in this blog and post it online.</p>

	<p><p>Hey friends, here&#39;s another blog post just created for the sake of filling space to see how things look. I think I&#39;ll use some Samuel L. Ipsum.</p>

<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that&#39;s what you see at a toy store. And you must think you&#39;re in a toy store, because you&#39;re here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>

<p>Like you, I used to think the world was this great place where everybody lived by the same standards I did, then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world where righteousness is not rewarded. That&#39;s Cesar&#39;s world, and if you&#39;re not willing to play by his rules, then you&#39;re gonna have to pay the price.</p>

<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show&#39;s called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they&#39;re going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don&#39;t, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

<p>Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every time you come home, they act like they haven&#39;t seen you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is they got different dogs for different people. Like pit bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man&#39;s best friend... or the wrong man&#39;s worst enemy. You going to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul.</p>

		<small>February 07, 2014</small>
	</h2>
	<p><p>For the sake of adding some more content as filler here is an excerpt from <em>War of the Worlds</em> by H.G. Wells:</p>

<p>The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big crescent of shipping, and the low Essex coast was growing blue and hazy, when a Martian appeared, small and faint in the remote distance, advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness.  At that the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and anger at his own delay, and the paddles seemed infected with his terror.  Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of the steamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than the trees or church towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human stride.</p>

<p>It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more amazed than terrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberately towards the shipping, wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell away.  Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another, striding over some stunted trees, and then yet another, still farther off, wading deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway up between sea and sky.  They were all stalking seaward, as if to intercept the escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between Foulness and the Naze.  In spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of the little paddle-boat, and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind her, she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance.</p>

<p>Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large crescent of shipping already writhing with the approaching terror; one ship passing behind another, another coming round from broadside to end on, steamships whistling and giving off volumes of steam, sails being let out, launches rushing hither and thither.  He was so fascinated by this and by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for anything seaward.  And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she had suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong from the seat upon which he was standing.  There was a shouting all about him, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answered faintly.  The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards from their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of a plough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in huge waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddles helplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck down almost to the waterline.</p>

	<p><p>Before this blog I was attempting to build a Rails blogging engine. I didn&#39;t give up on it so much as it wasn&#39;t the best use of my time. Blogging platforms have to many little detail features that make it time consuming. It&#39;s easy to get the big picture nailed down and forget all the little bits and pieces behind the scenes. So I&#39;ve decided to host a <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> blog on <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. It&#39;s free and easy, I can write in Markdown and have it automatically converted to HTML. A simple git push keeps it current.</p>

<p>I&#39;m blogging because I think it&#39;s an excellent way to think about and analyze the content I&#39;m always reading. I read so many headlines and skim so many articles that if a pub held a <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">HN</a> or <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a> themed triva night I&#39;d be the champ. But I don&#39;t develop my own opinions or arguments for what I read and I want to change that. Also, I want to improve my writing skills. </p>

<p>Hopefully there are a few posts already written after this one and they&#39;ve improved. Maybe later on there will be something you find interesting to keep you coming back. </p>
