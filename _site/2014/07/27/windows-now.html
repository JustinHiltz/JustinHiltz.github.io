<p>I&#39;m using Windows as my primary operating system at the moment because my Mac died (after I spilled coffee in it) and I don&#39;t have the funds to replace it quite yet. It&#39;s taking longer than I expected to get into the hang of writing code on this thing which is irritating because I finally have time to get back into programming after the busy period at work.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a couple months since I last wrote any serious code and I&#39;ve missed it. Now I want to get back into it and eventually do it professionally. To do that I need to learn a lot more and build some useful applications.</p>

<h3>The start</h3>

<p>I&#39;m going to do a quick refresh of JavaScript and then jump into it a little more in depth. Since I&#39;m comfortable with HTML and CSS I think that&#39;s a pretty good place to start. </p>

<h3>The blog</h3>

<p>To keep track of my learning progress I&#39;m going to write in this blog and post it online.</p>
