Before this blog I was attempting to build a Rails blogging engine. I didn't give up on it so much as it wasn't the best use of my time. Blogging platforms have to many little detail features that make it time consuming. It's easy to get the big picture nailed down and forget all the little bits and pieces behind the scenes. So I've decided to host a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) blog on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). It's free and easy, I can write in Markdown and have it automatically converted to HTML. A simple git push keeps it current.


I'm blogging because I think it's an excellent way to think about and analyze the content I'm always reading. I read so many headlines and skim so many articles that if a pub held a [HN](http://news.ycombinator.com) or [reddit](http://reddit.com) themed triva night I'd be the champ. But I don't develop my own opinions or arguments for what I read and I want to change that. Also, I want to improve my writing skills. 


Hopefully there are a few posts already written after this one and they've improved. Maybe later on there will be something you find interesting to keep you coming back.
