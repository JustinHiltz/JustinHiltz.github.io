I'm using Windows as my primary operating system at the moment because my Mac died (after I spilled coffee in it) and I don't have the funds to replace it quite yet. It's taking longer than I expected to get into the hang of writing code on this thing which is irritating because I finally have time to get back into programming after the busy period at work.

It's been a couple months since I last wrote any serious code and I've missed it. Now I want to get back into it and eventually do it professionally. To do that I need to learn a lot more and build some useful applications.

###The start

I'm going to do a quick refresh of JavaScript and then jump into it a little more in depth. Since I'm comfortable with HTML and CSS I think that's a pretty good place to start. 

###The blog

To keep track of my learning progress I'm going to write in this blog and post it online.
