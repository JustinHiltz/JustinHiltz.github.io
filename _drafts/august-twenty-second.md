Today I did something and I feel proud of myself for accomplishing that. It's become harder and harder to actually achieve something productive with my time rather than sitting on the computer and looking at reddit or binge-watching a show on Netflix. There's also a problem I have with "productive procrastination," where I'll read about things that could be vaguely related to the things I want to get done but not actually accomplish anything myself. 

I feel terrible and guilty every time I have the free time to make something or learn something and improve myself just to waste it away  doing the same lame things I do every day. I always put it off until the next day I have time thinking "I'll spend my entire day off writing code." I have a fantastic imagination when it comes to thinking of all the ways I'll be productive in the future. All the things I'll get done and skills I'll perfect. People will be tripping over each other just for the chance to throw their money at me for a small amount of my time. And in my imagination I'm completely capable of that. 

But in reality, as soon as I step out of the front door and into the world I become a nervous and unconfident fool who won't accomplish anything for himself. I feel as though I'm going to be laughed at and thrown out of the building if I apply for a job that I know I'm qualified for. Could this be a touch of  [Imposter Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome/ "Imposter Syndrome")? It's that fear of failure and making a fool of myself that gets me down and keeps me put in the rut that I'm in and I couldn't tell you the first step I need to take to get out.
