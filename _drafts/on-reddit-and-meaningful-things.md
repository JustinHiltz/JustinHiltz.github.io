Tonight I felt something that I haven't felt in a long time. I read an article in GQ,  [_The Strange & Curious Tale of the Last True Hermit_](http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201409/the-last-true-hermit/ "The Strange & Curious Tale of the Last True Hermit"), and I could not stop reading. I know I have trouble finishing things I start and newspaper and magazine articles are no exception. As are television shows, movies, projects and more. Pretty much everything in my life to date has loose ends. Most things have more than lose ends and are closer to the beginning than to the end. 

This week I've been trying so figure out how I can be productive and get my life on track and finishing this article in the way I finished it, believe it or not, has filled me with the confidence to continue doing so. Like  I said at the beginning, I felt something I haven't felt in a long time. Sure, I've finished reading things before but have I been attentive the whole way through? I got a rise tonight, something of a high, reading this article. The feeling like when playing a video game where matching patterns at an increasing speed is a requirement. You feel overwhelmed and stumble. When blowing into a baby's face and they don't know how to handle it. I can't seem to describe the feeling adequately but it felt like a runners' high.
