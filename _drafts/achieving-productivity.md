I have attempted college three times (I'm in my third program now) and I'm still unsure of what I want to do. I left my job to pursue a career as a developer and while I'm in school for that right now I'm not happy with the progress I've made. Before I returned to school I had some ideas in my head that I would learn web development in my free time away from my college courses and I'd make some money on the side doing some freelance work. My focus just wasn't there. I spent a lot of time studying web development technologies but that's my problem, spending all this time studying different languages and frameworks and not mastering any of them. 

The thing is I really do want to become a developer and the web is a platform I find fascinating. It's such a rapidly expanding world with exciting new technologies coming out every day. It's overwhelming because I want to try them all so I never get anything done. Coupled with the fact that I critique my work so harshly that I convince myself that I'm not worth the money for someone to hire me. Something that Ira Glass said in and interview on storytelling popped up in my Internet browsing today that I can relate to. He says that [and I'll get a direct transcription] for the first couple years that you're making things they won't be great, at least to you, and that's because you have great taste. That great taste is what allows you to not put out work that's 'good enough.' I'm somewhere in between the great taste, not good enough and just been plain scared shitless [Merlin? The Shakes poop pants?] to ask people to pay me to do work for them even though I'm quite capable. 



So what I'm trying to solve with this post is how do I get myself into a productive place.  How do I put together a killer portfolio to show off to people? How do I organize my time? What language, framework, etc should I choose to master?

Shit that's a lot of stuff to write about. Clearly this isn't just going to be a Friday night write this and be done with it. It's gonna be big and hopefully great.
