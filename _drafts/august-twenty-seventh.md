Today I pruned some trees and shuffled them around a bit in hopes that we might sell a few more than we have been. It was a thrilling day. 

The struggle for me is to keep the feeling of moving forward consistent so I can make some real progress achieving my goals. I really want to get a job in Toronto and I really want to be a developer. What I can't figure out though is how to stick to the learning process enough to get good at the job. I keep thinking it's a lack of interest and I'm deceiving myself into thinking I want to be a programmer but I don't think so. I consume everything to do with programming, especially in the areas of Apple and the web, and I'm pretty geek focused in everything else I do. Also, I don't really have this passion directed at any other area. Who knows, maybe this journal entry is another way for me to justify something to myself that isn't going to happen. 

My life is boring and it's not going anywhere. Any inspiration or direction on how to change it would be appreciated.

Love, Justin
